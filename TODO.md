# Design Tool Development TODO

This document outlines the development roadmap for the WYSIWYG web design tool, organized by priority levels from critical fixes to enhancement features.

## P0 ‚Äî Critical / Correctness Issues

### üîß Persistent Units for All CSS Properties
**Goal:** Selected elements must keep (and show) their chosen units (px, %, rem, em, vw, vh, etc.) across all editable properties.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `getActiveUnit(propertyName, elementId)` utility function
  - [ ] Read element's computed style or stored CSS class token
  - [ ] Resolve unit for property (default to app-wide unit if unset)
- [ ] Bind properties panel controls to unit resolver
- [ ] Store chosen unit alongside value in Redux slice for style editing
- [ ] Serialize units into CSS classes in IndexedDB

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Switching element selection never resets units to px
- [ ] Changing unit on margin-left does not affect width (units are per property)
- [ ] Undo/redo preserves units and values
- [ ] Reloading app restores units exactly as last saved

<!-- Implementation Note: This affects PropertiesPanel.tsx, PropertyInput.tsx, and the CSS generation system -->

### üì§ Export Button Behavior (Tab-Scoped HTML + Project-Named CSS)
**Goal:** Export only the current tab's HTML; CSS filename must equal the project name.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Hook Export action to active tab route (Wouter) and canvas state snapshot
- [ ] Generate HTML for active document tree only
- [ ] Generate single CSS file named `<projectName>.css`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Exporting on Tab A never includes Tab B content
- [ ] Downloaded CSS is `<projectName>.css`
- [ ] Re-importing the exported pair renders identically

<!-- Implementation Note: Requires updates to export functionality and HTML/CSS generators -->

### üé® Canvas Reflects `<body>` CSS
**Goal:** The Canvas visual equals `<body>` styling.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Apply computed `<body>` class tokens to canvas host
- [ ] Mirror background, color, font, line-height from `<body>` into canvas root

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Body background set in app instantly appears in canvas
- [ ] Exported HTML/CSS renders the same look outside the app

<!-- Implementation Note: This affects Canvas.tsx and the CSS application system -->

### üìç Insertion Rules on Invalid Recipients
**Goal:** When dropping onto an invalid recipient, element inserts before or after target based on mouse position.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement drag-over logic for invalid recipients
- [ ] Use bounding box midpoint: upper half ‚Üí insert before, lower half ‚Üí insert after
- [ ] Show clear placement indicator (line/ghost)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Dropping on `<span>` or locked instance still inserts above/below consistently
- [ ] Undo/redo preserves exact position

<!-- Implementation Note: This affects Canvas.tsx insertion detection logic -->

### üéØ Insert in Canvas Padding = Top/Bottom of DOM
**Goal:** Dropping in upper padding inserts at document top; lower padding inserts at bottom.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Create two drop zones mapped to document start/end
- [ ] Maintain visual affordances at top/bottom

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Dropping in top gutter inserts at index 0
- [ ] Dropping in bottom gutter appends to the end

<!-- Implementation Note: Requires canvas padding detection and insertion zone logic -->

## P1 ‚Äî High Priority / UX & Platform

### üì± Breakpoints = Real Media Queries (Mobile-First)
**Goal:** Setting properties with breakpoint active writes properties into mobile‚Äëfirst cascade using media queries.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Maintain breakpoint context (base, sm, md, lg, xl)
- [ ] When editing in md, write base rules for mobile-first and overrides in `@media (min-width: md)`
- [ ] CSS generator merges per-breakpoint tokens into minimal output

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Color set at base applies everywhere unless overridden at larger breakpoints
- [ ] Switching breakpoints updates which controls are "active/overridden"
- [ ] Exported CSS contains correct `@media` blocks with no duplicate base rules

### üåê i18n (EN/FR) Across the Interface
**Goal:** Full bilingual UI.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Integrate react-i18next
- [ ] Create `en.json` and `fr.json`; wrap all strings with `t()`
- [ ] Persist user language in settings (IndexedDB)
- [ ] Auto-detect from browser with manual override

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Language switch instantly updates all UI, tooltips, dialogs, validation messages
- [ ] New tabs and dialogs open in selected language

### üîó Import Web Page + CSS Scoping (Fix Broken Flow)
**Goal:** Import external HTML+CSS and scope styles so they don't leak.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Parse HTML into element tree, mapping unknown tags to known element types
- [ ] Generate unique data-attribute (e.g., `data-scope="imp-xxxxx"`) on imported root
- [ ] Rewrite selectors to `:where([data-scope="imp-xxxxx"] ...)` to minimize specificity
- [ ] Resolve URL assets; inline small assets (<= 2MB) into IndexedDB

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Imported styles affect only imported content
- [ ] No collisions with app UI or other tabs
- [ ] Export maintains selectors without app-internal prefixes

<!-- Implementation Note: This fixes the existing WebsiteImport.tsx functionality -->

### üå≥ Element Tree Toggle Button Relocation
**Goal:** Place Element Tree toggle next to Component Panel toggle, show at right side.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Move toggle control into right-hand toolbar cluster
- [ ] Preserve keyboard shortcut unchanged

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Visual order matches spec; click toggles Element Tree panel

### ‚úèÔ∏è Tabs: Rename by Double-Click
**Goal:** Double-click tab label to rename.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement `dblclick` ‚Üí inline edit input with focus trapping
- [ ] Handle Enter/Escape keys
- [ ] Persist to Redux + IndexedDB
- [ ] Validate uniqueness per project

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Names update instantly across UI and in export
- [ ] Undo/redo returns previous name

### üè∑Ô∏è Semantic Elements Parity with Rectangle (div)
**Goal:** nav, section, main, aside have same properties and behaviors as div.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Ensure element model exposes same editable property groups for semantic elements
- [ ] Ensure recipient rules allow children consistent with HTML semantics
- [ ] Don't restrict styling capabilities

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Selecting `<nav>` shows full properties set
- [ ] CSS generation emits correct tag selectors or class tokens identically to div

## P2 ‚Äî Medium Priority / Power-User Features

### üß© Component Editing via Tabs (Double-Click to Open)
**Goal:** Double-clicking component instance opens new component editor tab with ghost root.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Create tab keyed by component id when not already open
- [ ] Editor uses isolated canvas with ghost root; lock external context
- [ ] On save/close: increment component version, propagate updates to all instances

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Double-click on instance opens component tab
- [ ] Saving updates every instance; detach instances remain unchanged
- [ ] Closing via (X) behaves like save-or-discard (prompt on dirty state)

### üìè Component Size Inherits Content
**Goal:** Newly inserted component sizes to its content (no arbitrary fixed size).

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Default display to `display: block` with no fixed width/height
- [ ] Allow content/intrinsic sizing
- [ ] Apply explicit size constraints only if component's first render has them

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Inserting component wraps snugly around content unless user sets dimensions

### üéõÔ∏è Button State Gallery ‚Äî Full Gallery + Functional Preview
**Goal:** Show all button states side‚Äëby‚Äëside and allow interactive preview.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Grid view with tiles for default, hover, active, focus, disabled
- [ ] Toggle "Auto-cycle" demo and manual state testing (mouse/keyboard/focus)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Styles per state render exactly as defined
- [ ] Copy/export produces CSS for all states

<!-- Implementation Note: This enhances the existing button design system -->

### üìê Rulers (Horizontal & Vertical) with Configurable Units + Selection Markers
**Goal:** Add top/left rulers showing position with app's unit system; show markers for selected element bounds.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Ruler overlays synced with canvas scroll/zoom
- [ ] Unit config sourced from new units system; update ticks on zoom
- [ ] Selection draws ticks/lines along rulers at element edges

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Zooming updates tick density
- [ ] Selecting element shows correct markers on both rulers

### üìè Draggable Guides from Rulers (Show/Hide/Lock)
**Goal:** Create guides for alignment; lockable and per‚Äëtab persistent.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Drag from ruler to create guide; double‚Äëclick ruler removes nearest guide
- [ ] Context menu: hide/show all, lock/unlock all
- [ ] Snap elements to guides (with modifier to ignore)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Guides persist in IndexedDB per tab
- [ ] Elements snap within small threshold; locked guides not draggable

## P3 ‚Äî Robustness / Constraints

### üéõÔ∏è Display Type & Positioning Correctness
**Goal:** Ensure all display types and positioning modes work. Prevent abs-pos elements from being dragged outside canvas.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Normalize controls for display, position, top/right/bottom/left, z-index
- [ ] Drag constraints: clamp element's bounding box to canvas bounds during drag
- [ ] Resize handles active for abs-pos elements; keep within canvas

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Switching display/position reflect immediately in canvas and exported CSS
- [ ] Abs-pos elements cannot be lost off-screen; resize/drag feels unrestricted inside canvas

## Always-On Polish (Can Be Done Alongside)

### ‚ôø Element Insertion UX Feedback
**Goal:** Clear, accessible indicators for insertion points.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] High-contrast insertion line + ARIA live region
- [ ] Announce "Insert before X" / "Insert after X" / "Insert at top/bottom"

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Screen readers announce insertion target
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA contrast confirmed

## Notes & Dependencies

### üîÑ State & Persistence
All new UI state and style tokens must round-trip through Redux Toolkit and IndexedDB (class-first model), and work with undo/redo.

### üì§üì• Export/Import
Keep HTML/CSS generators and parsers in sync with breakpoint, units, and scoping changes.

### ‚ôø Accessibility
Follow WCAG 2.1 AA‚Äîfocus states, keyboard access (rename, toggles, drag alternatives), and ARIA where indicated.

### üß™ Testing
Add unit tests for utilities (`getActiveUnit`, breakpoint serialization), and integration tests for export, import, and insertion rules.
